Hey, i would prefer that you load the pickle file i added (library.pickle) at the 'frontend' directory.
I tried to do it as realisticly as i can-
    There are 3 main options:
    1. Existing customer
        - Loan a book
        - Return a book
    2. New customer
        - Create new customer
    3. Librarian account
        - Library Control
          - Display all customers
          - Display all books in the library (that are not loaned)
          - Display all active loans
          - Display all late loans
        - Book Control
          - Add new book
          - Remove a book
          - Find book by name
          - Find book by author
        - Customer Control
          - Display all loans for specific customer
          - Remove customer
          - Find customer by full name
          
          
      Most of the code revolve around Customer_id or Book_id.
      i hope its all good. i put much effort into this project and im proud of the outcome!
      good luck
